Early life and career
Elon Musk and his brother started Zip2, a software company, in 1995. In 1999 he sold it and became a millionaire. He then started X.com, which merged with the company Confinity to make PayPal. X.com was then renamed to PayPal, and he focused on growing that part of the company.[5][6] He then started SpaceX and became the CEO of Tesla.

He has Asperger syndrome.

Musk was born to a Canadian mother and a South African-born British father in Pretoria, South Africa.[7] His parents divorced in 1980 and he mainly lived with his father in many different places in South Africa.[8] He went to Waterkloof House Preparatory School and graduated from Pretoria Boys High School. He then moved to Canada in 1988 when he was 17 after he obtained Canadian citizenship through his mother. He got it before his South African military service was to begin. He felt that it would be easier to immigrate into the United States from Canada than from South Africa.

Education
He spent two years at the Queen's School of Business in Kingston, Ontario. He then transferred to the University of Pennsylvania where he earned a bachelor's degree in economics from the Wharton School. He stayed a year to finish his second bachelor's degree in physics. Then he moved to California to attempt to get a PhD in applied physics at Stanford but he left the program after only two days because he wanted to pursue his entrepreneurial aspirations (start businesses) in the Internet, renewable energy and outer space.[9] He became an American citizen in 2002.[10]

Projects
At the end of 2016, Musk founded The Boring Company which focuses on tunneling and infrastructure. He mentioned Los Angeles traffic as the reason for starting this company. In March 2017 Elon Musk announced he had started another company that aimed to merge human brains and computer called Neuralink.

As of April 2016, he was worth over $10 billion, making him the 37th most wealthy American.[11] Musk is also known for helping design and create the Falcon Heavy rocket, which successfully launched on February 6 of 2018.
